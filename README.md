# Listies

Listies is a [web app](https://listies.herokuapp.com/) for creating, managing and sharing lists.

## Requirements

- [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) as the de facto standard JavaScript runtime.

- The scripts are built with [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) in mind but [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) is fine.

## Installation

Download the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Flash-Git/Listies.git
```

Navigate to the root of the project and install the dependencies for both the client and server:

```bash
cd Listies
yarn devInstall
```

Start both the client and server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to your local address on port 3000:

<http://localhost:3000/>
